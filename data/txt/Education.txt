                a) With Student's guardian :- Interaction with guardian is very
                important for proper results from students. Parents of these
                children are so busy with there own life that they don't have
                time to think for there childern's future. But stil we are not
                losing hopes. We go to those slum area and intract with them and
                discuss about importance of education.</p>
